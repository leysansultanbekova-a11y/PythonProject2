# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

We were thinking of doing a NYT Connections sort of game, where we set up 4 groups of 4 words seperated into a randomized grid and the user has to choose which 4 words are paired together. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Yes, I plan on working with Nicole Conelly and Heidi Wright. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

No, I do not.
