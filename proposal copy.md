# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Connecting 4x4

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Our project is a game that presents the user with 16 words in a grid, which are split into 4 groups of 4 words. The user has to guess the premises of the 4 roups and choose 4 words that go together 4 seperate times. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will shuffle a list of 16 words, and then randomly assign each word into a bax and form a 4x4 grid. From there, the user will have to choose 4 groups of 4 words in which each group is tied together by a common theme (such as they all start with vowels). Each group's "common theme" will be varying in difficulty, starting from easy to extremely difficult. When the user selects a group correctly, the words will be put together to make the appearance more organized. Additionally, the user will also only have 4 tries to group the words correctly. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
